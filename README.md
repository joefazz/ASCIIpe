A simple maze that runs on the unix terminal.

This is what I came up with for my first year of univerisity coursework. It is a randomly generating
maze game based on a questionable recursive backtracking algorithm. The code is of my own design and
is 100% my own. The aim of the coursework was to make sure that our understanding of C++ was sound.
I recieved full marks for my coding and am still proud of it.

The lifesaver library I used is called ncurses of which there is extensive documentation of online.
This library would allow me to size the window to whatever I wanted and then using the dimensions of 
the window I could map out the maze using 'coordinates'.

When I intialially came up with this idea I wanted there to be a few additional features that I didn't
end up having the time to complete. One day I hope to come back to this project and add those features
such as a high score tracker and having a 'chaser' character a la Pacman. 

In this repo I have also included the report write up that I submitted with the code.
